####################---> Description <---##################### 
#
#    The AutoModeModule class is responsible for managing the correct steering
#   for robot in auto mode - without external input.
#
#   Concept:
#   This module reads movement instructions from a JSON file, converts them 
#   into binary-encoded frames, and sends these frames over a serial interface 
#   to an Arduino for execution. The path is predefined in the JSON file and 
#   consists of actions like "Turn" and "forward".
#
#   Each instruction is converted into a 5-byte frame, which is structured as:
#     - Byte 0: Action type (1 for "Turn", 0 for "forward")
#     - Byte 1: Direction (for "Turn") or Distance (for "forward")
#     - Bytes 2-3: Angle (for "Turn") or Speed (for "forward") â€“ packed as a 2-byte unsigned integer
#     - Byte 4: Reserved for future use
#
#   By sending fixed-length 5-byte frames, the data can be easily parsed and
#   interpreted on the Arduino side.
